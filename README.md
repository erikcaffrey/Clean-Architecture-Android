# Clean Architecture on Android. (EUROCUP 2016) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erikjhordan-rey/Clean-Architecture-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/erikjhordan-rey/Clean-Architecture-Android)

Example Android Clean Architecture used to explain how to use this architecture (rules) in our android applications.
This example was created to support an article explaining that I have written about how to architect an android application using Uncle Bob's clean architecture. [Aplicando Clean Architecture en Android][1] (Spanish).
